# Linear-Algebra-Based-Python-3D-Graphics-Renderer
First Year CS Project for the course of Linear Algebra based from https://www.youtube.com/@CoderSpaceChannel

Added more features that demonstrate linear transformations through keybinds.

Only uses python 3.11 (Maybe 3.12 if updated, no time to fix) :C
